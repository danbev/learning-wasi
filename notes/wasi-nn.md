## Wasi Neural Network (nn)
This is a [proposal] for a wasi api for performing machine learning inferense.

This is concerned not with the machine learning model but with the result of
the training of the model. These are files that describes the models weights
which can then be used in the inferense. It is this inferense that wasi-nn
is all about.
